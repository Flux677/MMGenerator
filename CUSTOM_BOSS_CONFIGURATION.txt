BOSS SUGGESTION #1: "TIDE CALLER - LORD OF THE DEPTHS"

Buat environmental manipulation boss "Tide Caller - Lord of the Depths" dengan konsep unik water control:

=== CORE CONCEPT ===

=== STATS ===
- HP: 900
- Damage: 12 (medium, bukan main threat)
- Armor: 10
- Speed: 0.25 on land, 0.45 in water (faster underwater!)

⚡ BOSS SUGGESTION #2: "STORM BRINGER - HERALD OF LIGHTNING"

Buat chain lightning boss "Storm Bringer - Herald of Lightning" dengan mechanics yang punish grouping:

=== CORE CONCEPT ===
Boss yang reverse normal party dynamics.
SOLO = easier (no chain targets)
PARTY = harder (chain lightning deadly)
Forces players to SPREAD OUT, not group up.

=== STATS ===
- HP: 800
- Damage: 15 base, up to 60 with chains!
- Armor: 8
- Speed: 0.35

=== CHAIN LIGHTNING SYSTEM (Core Mechanic) ===

How It Works:
1. Boss strikes primary target (15 damage)
2. Lightning CHAINS to nearest player within 8 blocks
3. Each chain adds +10 damage (25, 35, 45, 55...)
4. Maximum 5 chains (60 damage final target!)
5. Each target takes full chain damage

Example:
- Player A (primary): 15 damage
- Player B (8 blocks from A): 25 damage
- Player C (7 blocks from B): 35 damage
- Player D (6 blocks from C): 45 damage
Result: All 4 players damaged, total 120 damage dealt!

Technical Implementation:
- Initial strike: damage{a=15} @target
- Check radius: @PIR{r=8;limit=1;sort=NEAREST} from first target
- Repeat chain: variableMath{var=caster.chain_count;operation=ADD;value=1}
- Damage increases: damage{a=<15+<caster.var.chain_count>*10>}
- Visual: lightning particles + effect:sound between targets
- Variable tracking: who was hit (prevent double-hit)

Counterplay:
- Spread out (>8 blocks apart)
- Designated "tank" takes first hit
- Coordination essential

=== THUNDER MARK SYSTEM ===

Mark Mechanic:
1. Boss marks 1-3 players (random)
2. Red lightning particle above head
3. Countdown: 5 seconds (visible bossbar)
4. After 5s: Lightning strikes marked player(s)
5. Damage: 30 + chain from other marked players

Multi-Mark Danger:
- If 3 players marked AND close together:
  * Chain between all 3
  * Each takes 30+40+50 = 120 damage total
  * Wipe potential!

Mark Variables:
- var: target.marked (true/false)
- var: target.mark_timer (countdown from 100 ticks)
- var: caster.marks_active (count how many)

Counterplay:
- Marked players RUN AWAY from team
- Unmarked players help clear path
- Use terrain (pillars) as blockers

=== STATIC FIELD AURA ===

Persistent Debuff:
- 10 block radius around boss
- Players inside take:
  * Slow II (movement -60%)
  * 2 damage per second
  * Mining Fatigue (can't break blocks)
  * Vulnerability: +50% damage from chains

Strategic Implications:
- Melee risky (always in aura)
- Ranged safer (outside aura)
- Must "dance" in and out
- Glass cannon players avoid at all costs

Technical:
- potion{t=SLOW;d=20;l=2} @PIR{r=10} ~onTimer:20
- damage{a=2} @PIR{r=10} ~onTimer:20
- Variable: var=target.in_static_field (true/false)
- Damage modifier: if in field, chains deal +50%

=== OVERLOAD MECHANIC (<10% HP) ===

Desperation Move:
- Boss health <10%
- Charges for 8 seconds (telegraph)
- Visual: Massive lightning particles, screen shake
- Audio: Loud thunder buildup
- Message: "&c&l⚡ OVERLOAD IMMINENT! ⚡"

Effect:
- AOE explosion (25 block radius)
- Damage: 100 (instant kill most players)
- Boss dies in explosion (self-destruct)

Counterplay:
- RUN AWAY (>25 blocks)
- Use terrain to hide (break LOS)
- Teleport if possible
- Last ditch attempt by boss

Technical:
- Condition: health{h=<10%} + varequals{var=caster.overload_ready;val=true}
- Charge: delay 160 ticks (8 seconds)
- Visual: particles spam, recoil screen shake
- Damage: damage{a=100;ignorearmor=true} @PIR{r=25}
- Boss remove: remove{delay=0} @self

=== STORM CALL ULTIMATE ===

Arena-Wide Attack:
